          <strong>
            Biography:
          </strong>
          I'm a Cuban-American male that has lived in South Florida for the majority of my life. I immigrated here with my parents when I was one year old. Since, I have built a lot of working experience by doing a multitude of different jobs in a
          variety of sectors. I'm a very motivated and intelligent individual in the search of excellence both in my work and personal life. Also, fitness is a big part of my life. I spend countless hours in the gym to improve both my energy and
          wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I spend a great amount of time self-educating myself. I read a lot of books ranging from investing (options, value investing, techinical analysis & commodities speculation), science, psychology, mathematics, biographies, real estate, note investing and many more. My favorite books
          are, “You Too Can Be a Stock Market Genius”, “The Intelligent Investor”, “Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds”, “Unleash the Giant Within”, “Think and Grow Rich”, “The Navigator”, and “The E-Myth Revisited”. As Sir
          Isaac Newton said himself, “If I have seen further than others, it is because I was standing on the shoulders of giants.”
